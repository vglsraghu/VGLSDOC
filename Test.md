## What Is Foreign Exchange (Forex)?

**Foreign Exchange (forex or FX)** is the trading of one currency for another. 
For example, one can swap the U.S. dollar for the euro.
_Foreign exchange_ transactions can take place on the foreign exchange market, also known as the Forex Market.
The forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world, with trillions of dollars changing hands every day.
There is no centralized location, rather the forex market is an electronic network of banks, brokers, institutions, and individual traders (mostly trading through brokers or banks).

## How Does Foreign Exchange Work?

The market determines the value, also known as an exchange rate, of the majority of currencies. 
Foreign exchange can be as simple as changing one currency for another at a local bank.
It can also involve trading currency on the foreign exchange market.
_For example_, a trader is betting a central bank will ease or tighten monetary policy and that one currency will strengthen versus the other.

### Other Features

| Features | Description |
|----------|-------------|
|The Spot Market| Spot for most currencies is two business days; the major exception is the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, which settles on the next business day. Other pairs settle in two business days. During periods that have multiple holidays, such as Easter or Christmas, spot transactions can take as long as six days to settle. The price is established on the trade date, but money is exchanged on the value date.|
| Spot Exchange Rate Transactions | For most spot foreign exchange transactions, the settlement date is two business days after the transaction date. The most common exception to the rule is the U.S. dollar vs. the Canadian dollar, which settles on the next business day. Weekends and holidays mean that two business days is often far more than two calendar days, especially during the Christmas and Easter holiday season. |
|Currency Forward| A currency forward is a binding contract in the foreign exchange market that locks in the exchange rate for the purchase or sale of a currency on a future date. A currency forward is essentially a customizable hedging tool that does not involve an upfront margin payment. The other major benefit of a currency forward is that its terms are not standardized and can be tailored to a particular amount and for any maturity or delivery period, unlike exchange-traded currency futures.|
